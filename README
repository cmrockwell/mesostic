This is an example of a mesostic poem.

      of thIs
      modesT

    a room Holding
tons of lovE
       (&, Naturally, much good food, too)
       
There are two types of mesostic: fifty percent and one hundred percent. 
In a fifty-percent mesostic, "Between any two [capitalized] letters, you can't have the second [letter]." 
In a one-hundred-percent mesostic, "Between any two [capitalized] letters, you can't have either [letter]."
