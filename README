This is an example of a mesostic poem.

  let us maKe

       (&, Naturally, much good food, too)
       
	There are two types of mesostic: fifty percent and one hundred percent. 
In a fifty-percent mesostic, "Between any two [spine] letters, you can't have the second [letter]." 
In a one-hundred-percent mesostic, "Between any two [spine] letters, you can't have either [letter]."

	Louis Mink, the author of A Finnegans Wake Gazetter, proposed that a "pure mesostic" might not iterate 
either of the index letters in the words between those letters so that each line becomes a short lipogram.
